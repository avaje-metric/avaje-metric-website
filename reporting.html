  <h3>MetricReportManager</h3>
  <p>
    MetricReportManager is part of <code>avaje-metric-core</code>. What it does is periodically
    collect the metrics from the MetricManager and send then to any registered reporters.
    You typically specify the frequency in which metrics should be reported and the reporter(s)
    to use.
  </p>

  <p>
    MetricReportManager can support 2 ReportWriters so if you wish to write the metrics both to the
    local file system and additionally send them to a remote repository you can do that.
  </p>
  <h4>Example: MetricReportManager</h4>
  ```java
  import org.avaje.metric.report.FileReporter;
  import org.avaje.metric.report.MetricReportManager;
  ...

  // Just use the simple FileReporter that comes with avaje-metric-core.
  // Writes metrics in a csv format every 60 seconds. Defaults to write a
  // daily file and keep a maximum of 20 files

  FileReporter file = new FileReporter();
  MetricReportManager reportManager = new MetricReportManager(60, file);
  ```

  <a class="anchor" name="file"></a>
  <h3>FileReporter</h3>
  <p>
    FileReporter writes the metrics to the local file system. It will write to a daily file
    by adding the date into the name of the file it writes to. You can specify the maximum
    number of files that you want to keep and FileReporter will delete any older metric files
    automatically.
  </p>

```java

  /**
   * Wire up the MetricReportManager with appropriate ReportWriters.
   */
  @Singleton
  public class MetricService {

    static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MetricService.class);

    final MetricReportManager reportManager;

    @Autowired
    public MetricService(String directory, String fileName, int freqInSeconds) {

      logger.info("metrics directory:{} file:{} freqInSeconds:{}", directory, fileName, freqInSeconds);

      CsvReportWriter csvReportWriter = new CsvReportWriter();

      // specify the directory to write the metrics to and fileName prefix
      FileReporter reporter = new FileReporter(directory, fileName, csvReportWriter);

      reportManager = new MetricReportManager(freqInSeconds, reporter);
    }
  }

```

  <a class="anchor" name="metricReporter"></a>
  <h3>MetricReporter interface</h3>
  <p>
    You can write your own MetricReporter implementation.
  </p>

```java
  package org.avaje.metric.report;

   /**
    * Defines interface for reporting metrics.
    *
    * Construct and then pass the MetricReporter into one
    * of the constructors for MetricReportManager.
    */
    public interface MetricReporter {

   /**
    * Report the collected metrics. These metrics are all
    * known to have non-empty values.
    */
    public void report(ReportMetrics reportMetrics);

   /**
    * Perform periodic cleanup of any resources
    * (e.g. only keep x days of metrics files).
    *
    * By default this will be called approximately every 8 hours
    * and is intended to be used to cleanup old files created by
    * the likes of FileReporter (only keep x days of metrics files).
    */
    public void cleanup();

  }
```

  <h4>ReportMetrics Bean:</h4>
  <p>
    ReportMetrics is a bean that holds the collected metrics, collection time
    and environment information (Application, Server, Environment etc).
  </p>
```java

 /**
  * This is the environment specific information - Application,
  * Environment, Server etc.
  */
  protected final HeaderInfo headerInfo;

 /**
  * The time the metrics were collected. This is used to determine
  * the duration for each metric which is the time since its last collection.
  */
  protected final long collectionTime;

 /**
  * The metrics that were collected that were not empty. Metrics that
  * didn't have events occur are considered empty and not reported.
  */
  protected final List<Metric> metrics;

```
